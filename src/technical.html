                            <span>IXPs fall roughly into five categories: non-profit organization, an association of ISPs, operator-neutral for-profit company, university or gov agency, or an informal association of networks. ix.kw is an autonomous non-profit division of CITRA that operates under the directions of a community constituted board of directors.</span>

							<h2>Business Case</h2>
                            <span>IXPs provide a competitive alternative to routing domestically destined traffic abroad. IXP viability can be calculated for interested ISPs by comparing the cost of IP transit to the cost of domestic peering.
