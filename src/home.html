							<h4>IX.KW <span>Objective </span>:</h4>
						</div>

						<p>ix.kw’s primary objective is local IP peering and excludes any commercial international transit services. ix.kw does not and will not provide any telecommunications services or create any of its own IP traffic, but will only provide physical facility management service of the location for licensed operators that will provide individual telecommunication links and routing of IP traffic to and from the physical exchange.</p>

							<h4>What is <span>IX.KW </span>:</h4>
						</div>

						<p>ix.kw is Kuwait is a not-for-profit carrier neutral, community-directed Internet Exchange Point and provides high speed, reliable, resilient IP traffic exchange facilities interconnecting Kuwait’s local internet traffic.</p>

							<h4>IX.KW <span>Mission </span>:</h4>
						</div>

						<p>We provide carrier neutral facility for ISPs and operators of Internet Protocol (IP) networks to interconnect and exchange traffic (peer) in Kuwait. Connecting to ix.kw is easy, and open to any network that has its own IP address space and an autonomous system number.</p>

							<h4> </h4>
						</div>
                            <p>Prior to ix.kw, all inter-network traffic, both domestic and foreign bound was exchanged through exchanges outside the country. ISPs send all outbound traffic through their international links, the costs of which must be borne by either the sending or the receiving ISP.</p>
          
                            <p>ix.kw provides an optimal path for peered traffic to reach other networks within Kuwait, freeing international links from congestion, enhancing data speeds and reducing latency and costs.</p>
                        
                            <p>ix.kw is an autonomous division of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority (“CITRA”) of Kuwait.</p>
