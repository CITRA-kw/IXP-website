									<p>The head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority, Salem Al-Atheena, on Thursday stressed the importance attached by Kuwait to the regional network connectivity project. This came in a statement to KUNA at the end of his participation as head of the Kuwaiti delegation in the 22nd session of the Council of Arab Ministers of Communications and Information at the headquarters of the League of Arab States. In this context, Al-Atheena explained that Kuwait presented to the meeting a working paper on the regional network connectivity project which is scheduled to be discussed during the next meeting of the Arab Network Committee. He pointed out that the meeting discussed several issues through the fields of mail and communications, pointing out that there are several recommendations, most importantly the adoption of the results of the World Conference of Delegates Plenipotentiary held in the UAE. He pointed out that the meeting touched on many topics in the forefront of modern technology, Internet technology, artificial intelligence and so-called "portfolios" and the possibility of Arab countries entering this technology. He also noted the Arab efforts to unite efforts and expertise during the coming period in order to benefit peoples, facilitate procedures and make the life of Arab societies easier and better. Al-Atheena said that during its participation in the Executive Office of the Arab Ministers of Communications and Information Council in the previous session over the past two years, Kuwait has had multiple participations through proposals and working papers.</p>
